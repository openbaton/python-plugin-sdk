# Python version of the plugin-sdk
This project contains a Python SDK for writing VIM Drivers for Open Baton.

## Technical Requirements
This section covers the requirements that must be met by the plugin-sdk in order to satisfy the demands for such a component:

* python 3.5
* pika

## How to install python-plugin-sdk

The safer way to start is to use a [virtal environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). Once activated, just run

 ```bash
 pip install python-plugin-sdk
 ```

## How to use the SDK
After it is installed you can import the following modules into your project:

* org.openbaton.plugin.sdk.catalogue
* org.openbaton.plugin.sdk.utils
* org.openbaton.plugin.sdk.vim

The catalogue module contains classes that resemble their counterparts in the Java version of the catalogue e.g. a class for VIM instances, a class for NFVImages, etc.
The vim module contains the ```VimDriver``` class which should be extended by your specific VIM Driver class and which contains all the abstract methods that you have to implement for a working VIM Driver.
The utils module contains the logic for handling the VIM Driver's connection to the NFVO and the scheduling of tasks so that you do not have to handle these things at all. The most important function for you in this module is the ```start_vim_driver``` function.

In order to write your own VIM Driver you only have to implement the abstract methods of the ```org.openbaton.plugin.sdk.vim.VimDriver``` class and pass it to the ```org.openbaton.plugin.sdk.utils.start_vim_driver``` function. For an example have a look at the [openstack-python-vim-driver][openstack-python-vim-driver] implementation.

# What is Open Baton?

OpenBaton is an open source project providing a comprehensive implementation of the ETSI Management and Orchestration (MANO) specification.

Open Baton is a ETSI NFV MANO compliant framework. Open Baton was part of the OpenSDNCore (www.opensdncore.org) project started almost three years ago by Fraunhofer FOKUS with the objective of providing a compliant implementation of the ETSI NFV specification.

Open Baton is easily extensible. It integrates with OpenStack, and provides a plugin mechanism for supporting additional VIM types. It supports Network Service management either using a generic VNFM or interoperating with VNF-specific VNFM. It uses different mechanisms (REST or PUB/SUB) for interoperating with the VNFMs. It integrates with additional components for the runtime management of a Network Service. For instance, it provides autoscaling and fault management based on monitoring information coming from the the monitoring system available at the NFVI level.
